   Recently, in DMTN-085, the QA Strategy Working Group (QAWG) made specific recommendations to improveÂ the SQuaSH metrics dashboard. This technote presents an overview of the current implementation and a plan to implement what is missing.

Introduction
============

Summary of the QAWG recommendations to SQuaSH
=============================================

.. _qawg-rec-34:

QAWG-REC-34
    | SQuaSH should issue alerts to developers and key stakeholders on regressions in important metric values.

.. _qawg-rec-35:

QAWG-REC-35
    | Provide a single, reliable source of documentation describing the SQuaSH system and a vision for its use in DM-wide metric tracking

.. _qawg-rec-36:

QAWG-REC-36
    | The SQuaSH system should be closely coupled to the drill-down environment; in particular, the former should use the latter to enable drill-down functionality into particular metric values.

.. _qawg-rec-37:

QAWG-REC-37
    | It must be possible to submit metrics to SQuaSH from arbitrary pipeline execution environment.

.. _qawg-rec-38:

QAWG-REC-38
    | SQuaSH should be able to store and display appropriate metric values per DataId.


These recommendations help to define the scope and technical requirements for SQuaSH. In particular, |37| and  |38| have implications on how metric values are stored and visualized, including metadata from the verification jobs and the execution environment. |34| requires an automated regression detection and a notification system.  |36| suggests a new mechanism to expose metrics stored in SQuaSH to the notebook aspect of the LSST Science Platform (LSP) for exploratory analysis. Finally, |35| requires better user documentation.

Another general recommendation made by the QAWG is that the drill-down capability should be removed from SQuaSH and implemented in external dashboards or the notebook aspect of the LSP.
